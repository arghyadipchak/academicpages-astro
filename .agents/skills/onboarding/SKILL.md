# Academic Pages Astro Onboarding Skill 🚀

Operational runbook for AI coding assistants performing first-time personalization and repository onboarding for a user.

> 📚 **Canonical Reference Guides**:
>
> - **[Onboarding Checklist (`docs/ONBOARDING.md`)](../../../docs/ONBOARDING.md)**: Itemized checklist for identity, demo purge, route pruning, and scaffolding retirement
> - **[Site Configuration (`docs/CONFIG.md`)](../../../docs/CONFIG.md)**: Profile fields, verified handles, navigation structure, and redirects
> - **[Content Authoring (`docs/CONTENT.md`)](../../../docs/CONTENT.md)**: Frontmatter schemas and collection authoring templates

> ⚠️ **One-Time Lifecycle**: This skill and [`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](../../../docs/ONBOARDING.md) are intended solely for initial site setup. Once onboarding and verification are complete, follow Step 5 to delete this skill directory and `docs/ONBOARDING.md` to keep the repository clean.

## 1. Onboarding Protocol

Follow these sequential phases when personalizing the website for a user:

### Phase 1: Discovery Audit & User Alignment

1. **Audit Available Sources**: Review user-provided materials (CV, LaTeX resume, Google Scholar profile, GitHub username, existing website)
2. **Align on Sections**: Present a discovery summary and confirm with the user:
   - Which content collections to enable (`publications`, `talks`, `teaching`, `portfolio`, `blog`)
   - Whether to hide empty sections from navigation or supply draft entries

### Phase 2: Site Identity & Configuration

Execute **Section 1 & Section 4** of [`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](../../../docs/ONBOARDING.md) following [`docs/CONFIG.md`](../../../docs/CONFIG.md):

- Update `src/data/siteConfig.ts` with profile information and verified handles
- Update `src/data/navigation.ts` and `src/pages/sitemap.astro` for enabled sections
- Update `LICENSE` copyright notice while preserving upstream MIT lines
- **Rule**: Never remove, hide, or comment out the template attribution link in `src/components/Footer.astro` pointing to `academicpages-astro`

### Phase 3: Content Population & Demo Purge

Execute **Section 2 & Section 3** of [`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](../../../docs/ONBOARDING.md) following [`docs/CONTENT.md`](../../../docs/CONTENT.md):

- Populate user research entries, biography (`src/pages/index.astro`), and CV (`src/pages/cv.astro`)
- Customize `src/content/pages/terms.md` for institutional and hosting requirements
- Purge all demo markdown files, starter PDFs/slides (`public/files/`), and unused starter images (`public/images/`)

### Phase 4: Starter Tooling & Governance Retirement (Optional)

If requested by the user, execute **Section 5** of [`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](../../../docs/ONBOARDING.md) to retire test suites, favicon generator scripts, and template governance files.

### Phase 5: Verification & Onboarding Self-Destruction

1. Execute the verification quality gate from repository root:
   ```bash
   pnpm format
   pnpm verify
   pnpm build
   ```
2. Once verification passes with 0 errors, retire the onboarding checklist and skill directory:
   ```bash
   rm docs/ONBOARDING.md
   rm -rf .agents/skills/onboarding/
   ```
3. Direct subsequent content authoring to `.agents/skills/content-operations/` and template upgrades to `.agents/skills/template-sync/`
