A modern, type-safe academic website
======

Academic Pages Astro strictly separates your website's content from its layout. The content and metadata of your website live in structured Markdown files validated by Astro Content Collections and Zod schemas, while Astro components specify how to render that content into static HTML pages.

Features & Built-in Capabilities
------

- ⚡ **Astro 7 + Tailwind CSS v4**: Zero client JS by default, sub-second builds, and modern `@theme` design tokens
- 📚 **Academic Content Collections**: Structured collections for `publications`, `talks`, `teaching`, `portfolio`, `blog`, and `pages`
- 📋 **1-Click BibTeX Copy & Downloads**: Direct clipboard copy and badge links for papers, slide decks, and citation records
- 🎓 **Google Scholar & Highwire Press SEO**: Automatic citation meta tags for instant indexing by academic search engines
- 📐 **KaTeX Mathematical Typesetting**: Fast, server-rendered LaTeX math equations (e.g. $E = mc^2$ or $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$)
- 🔍 **Real-Time Client Search (`Cmd+K`)**: Keyboard-navigable modal search across all posts, papers, and talks
- 🌓 **Dark & Light Mode**: Instant theme switching with zero flash of unstyled content
